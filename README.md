Having spent many nights staying up to finish games while the rest of my family slept, I've since deduced that games played a bigg part of shaping who I am. Having since treaded through various DIY hobbies like building keyboards, assembling Gunpla and building makeshift furniture, and participating in various extra-curriculars like sports and cyber security competitions, I now embark on DIYing games. Too many hobbies, too little time.

As a chronically addicted gamer since his previous life, I've aspired to become a professional game developer to make games that I want to play, especially with others. As someone who made maps for Warcraft III and Starcraft II, as well as modding for games such as Skyrim and Terraria, I've come to the conclusion that there's so many games whose full potentials were never reached, and I plan to do something about that.

# The Role of Version Control in Software Development

## Ctrl-Z to Undo
CTRL-Z lets us undo changes in files we have open,
but it has limitations:
- What if you wanted to undo a change to a file you made weeks ago?
- What if you wanted to undo a change made to a file by someone else?
- What if you wanted to experiment with a series of changes and then revert back to a specific version of the file?

## Version Control
**Version control**, also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents like computer programs.
CTRL-Z is the simplest form of version control.
**Some documents have more advanced version control built-in:**
- Microsoft Word has a "Track Changes" feature.
- Google Docs automatically tracks file changes over.
- You can see the edit history of all Wikipedia articles.  
[(Here's the history of the version control article.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Version_control&action=history)

## More Than Just Undo
**Version control allows for more than just undoing things:**
- Work on new projects features while at the same time patching bugs found in older version of the code.
- Collaborate with someone on a projects without overwriting each other's work.
- Work with distributed teams of coders from around the world to develop open-source applications.

## Evolution of Version Control
**A Diary Analogy:**
- **Local Version Control:** Storing your diary under your pillow.
- **Centralized Version Control:** Storing a copy of your diary in a safety deposit box.
- **Distributed Version Control:** Making mulitiple copies to store with trusted friends.

## Why Should I Care About Version Control?
Solo or team, version control is your secret weapon for efficient and stress-free software development.
**It's your development safety net!**

## Different Version Control Systems
**Distributed VCS**
- **Git** - Free. Popular outside of game dev, especially for open source project.
- **Plastic SCM / Unity Version Control** - Paid. Now owned by Unity.
**Centralized VCS**
- **Perforce Helix Core** - Paid. Industry standard for large game dev shops.
- **Subversion** - Free. Classic choice for smaller / indie shops.

## Version Control with Git
- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.
- Git helps us keep track of the changes to our source code over the lifespan of a project.
- When combined with cloud version control sites like GitHub or GitLab, we can use git to collaborate with others remotely.

## Why Git?
- With Git, you can make a "commit", or a save point, as often as you'd like.
- You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you're working.
- Commit often and commit early, and you'll never have that gut sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.
- Allows us to work offline if necessarily and synchronize with a distributed team.

## Why Not Git?
**Downsides to working with git in game development:**
- Not especially user friendly for non-developers.
- No built-in support for large repos, although the Git LFS add-on exists.
- No built-in support for locking binary assets. (Locking can be enabled with Git LFS.)

## Some Git Resources
- [Git Guide](https://github.com/git-guides) - Official git Learning Guides from the folks at GitHub.
- [Git CheetSheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) - The most popular git commands in one page.
- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) - Free ebook provides a deep dive into everything git.

## A Brief History of Git
- The Git version control tool was created by Linus Torvalds, the same coder who created the Linux OS.
- Git development started when Bitkeeper, the version control tool being used for Linux development, revoked it's free license for Linux development.
- Development on Git started in April 2005, and by June it was already being used to handle the next Linux kernel release!

## Fancy Version Control Words
- **CLI** - Command Line Interface. The "Terminal" or "Shell" of your operating system. Git is a CLI tool but there are also graphical (GUI) interfaces.
- **Directory** - Used interchangeably with Folder.
- **Repository** - A collection of files and directories you are monitoring for changes using a version control tool. Sometimes shortened to repo.
- **Clone** - Local version of a repo, including all commits and branches.
- **Remote** - Server clone of repo that all team members synchronize to.
- **Graph** - A diagram of nodes connected by lines called edges. (See image below.)
- **Hash** - A string of characters that acts like a digital fingerprint for a file or portion of a file. The type of hash used by git is the SHA1 cryptographic hash.
- **Commit** - Snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA.
- **Branch** - A lightweight movable pointer to a set of commits.
- **HEAD** - The HEAD pointer is a reference to the most recent commit in your branch.
- **Working Directory** - The current state of your repo's files on disk.
- **DAG** - Directed Acyclic Graph. A graph were the edges are arrows (directed) and no matter which arrow you follow you can never travel in a circle (acyclic).

As a chronically addicted gamer since his previous life, I've aspired to become a professional game developer to make games that I want to play, especially with others. As someone who made maps for Warcraft III and Starcraft II, as well as modding for games such as Skyrim and Terraria, I've come to the conclusion that there's so many games whose full potentials were never reached, and I plan to do something about that.
